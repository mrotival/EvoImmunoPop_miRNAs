# Human Variation in miRNAs and isomiR response to infection

The present folder contains all scripts from the manuscript entitled 'Population variation of miRNAs and isomiRs and their impact on human immunity to infection'

These scripts are meant to provide additional transparency on the code underlying the results from the manuscript. However, these scripts are based on files that cannot be made publicly avaible, as some of them may contain sensitive genetic information. When possible we try to provide information on the content of the files and annotate the scripts to improve readability.

scripts are presented in the order they were written, which does not always match the order of the mansucript. Within each script, code used for generating figures and tables is highlighted.

Note however that some of the scripts may require high memory to be run, or parallelization through a cluster. In addition, some parts of the analysis have been rewritten to improve clarity of the pipeline. In doing so, some bugs may have escaped our vigilance. Thus the code is provided without warranty. If you try to rerun these analyses and encounter any problem, please report it to the author ( maxime.rotival@pasteur.fr ).
